### Description

This is a Messenger server that supports multiple clients, along with the client application. PLEASE VOTE FOR ME!! .. and if you have any questions/comments/suggestions, email me.
 
### More Info
 
It has a few errors and incomplete things, but could easily be expanded and turned into a full scale messenger server. It took me about 2 days to write. and it has quite a few functions that could easily be used for other applications.

no known side effects, if found e-mail me.
